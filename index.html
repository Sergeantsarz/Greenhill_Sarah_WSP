						Hello, everyone! My name is Sarah Greenhill and this is my portfolio site that will be a work in progress over the span of the coming month of October. There's nothing I love more than art and programming, so this project will help me to hone my skills and grow as an artist/programmer. A big issue being posed to us is semantics, their value, and how to use the newest things included in HTML5.

                    <p class="lead">This week, we've been tasked with the creation of a portfolio website in order to showcase the things that we wish to improve upon personally. The main thing that I would like to focus on this month is This site takes inspiration from, showcasing elements of a webpage that I would enjoy improving upon. The site that we have been provided with for inspiration is called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.templatemonster.com//">http://www.templatemonster.com/</a>.</p>

            <h1>Main Focus</h1>
            <p>The main focus for this month's WSP project will be the use of a Jumbotron/CTA that set itself apart from the most common ones out there. A great example that I have seen, setting itself apart from the rest, is a template that I found on templatemonster.com. I like it because it is designed different from most of the popular sites. When you use something like Bootstrap, it comes with the standard Jumbotron and you can immediately tell that someone has used the framework because of this. I like the way sites look with their eye-catching focus elements, but I would love to learn to use them in a way that isn't cookie-cutter. In my example, the website has the large image on the left side of the screen with a vertical navigation within. All the content rests to the right of it and scrolls accordingly. I would also like to include <strong>Responsive Design</strong> as something that I would dually like to focus on. So many websites look absolutely terrible in their mobile versions and their CTA areas are even worse than they are on a full fledged website.</p>
			<h2>What I'd like to learn:</h2>
			<p>I want to be able to create CTA areas of content in my webpages that are well placed, pleasing to the eye, and fulfill their purpose 100% without fail. In the past, my attempts at using this area of a site falls short. Even though these sections of a page are normally the first things someone sees when they are on your page, that doesn't mean it is a good use of space or a great CTA. I want to be able to make fully responsive websites that retain their strength and value even in a mobile format.</p>

                                <p>The first element that I would like to focus on is the nav element. The reason behind it is quite simple; every single website has a navigation of some kind. I would like to learn all the different ways that this semantic element can be used and be able to create wicked looking navigations that are just as pleasing to the eye and functional as the rest of the site.</p>

                                <p>The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links. Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate for the nav element. In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site, but the footer element is more appropriate in such cases, and no nav element is necessary for those links. - W3C</p>

                                <p>The second item that I would like to focus on are articles, even though it may seem like the name says it all; my research over this past week shows me that the article element has a lot more versatility to it than meets the eye. I would like to learn about and use articles to their fullest extent, because I am more likely to rely on divs with classes and ids in order to get my work done.</p>

                                <p>The article element represents a component of a page that consists of a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is intended to be independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. - W3C</p>

                                <p>Much like an article has a specific semantic meaning, so does the section. I want to be able to use sections in the same way as I can with articles, so that the code within the body of my HTML has semantic value and therefore becomes better by doing so. As I stated before, it is much more my practice to use divs with classes and ids in order to influence them with CSS instead of using the newer HTML5 elements associated with separating content while also retaining semantic meaning.</p>

                                <p>The section element represents a generic document or application section…The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. A general rule is that the section element is appropriate only if the element’s contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline. - W3C</p>

                                <p>Figures are something that I do not have very much experience working with. I have had to create a couple projects in past classes dealing with them, using them to contain images on a page, but other than that...my knowledge of them and their various uses is lacking. I want to research this element and how to use to properly, even now, I would have to read up on its exact usage and implementation because I do not have much experience using figures.</p>

                                <p>The figure element represents a unit of content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained, that is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document, and that can be moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the document’s meaning. - W3C</p>

                                <p>As I understand it, a figcaption is something that goes along with a figure and can only be a child element of one, but figures can contain other child elements. Even though this element is "optional" I think that knowing how and when to use this new HTML5 element would be useful, because it is not often that I, personally, have seen this used.</p>

                                <p>The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for a figure. The figcaption element is optional and can appear before or after the content within the figure. Only one figcaption element may be nested within a figure, although the figure element itself may contain multiple other child elements (e.g., img or code). - HTML5 Docotor</p>
