						Hello, everyone! My name is Sarah Greenhill and this is my portfolio site that will be a work in progress over the span of the coming month of October. There's nothing I love more than art and programming, so this project will help me to hone my skills and grow as an artist/programmer. A big issue being posed to us is semantics, their value, and how to use the newest things included in HTML5.

                    <p>This website is dedicated to the absorption and process of solidifying and honing our skills with HTML5 and CSS3 in order to create content on the web that is visually appealing, semantically relevant, and 100% validated. Inspiration for the focus of our research and development will be garnered from an outside source. The site that we have been provided with for inspiration is called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.templatemonster.com//">http://www.templatemonster.com/</a>.</p>

            <p>The Header: This component of a web page can be found all over the internet and contain a myriad of things like navigation, logos, information, advertisements, and more.</p>
			<h2>What I'd like to learn:</h2>
			<p>There are plenty of things that a programmer could choose from to focus on when it comes to the many different sorts of elements found in a typical web page. It's our task, during this month, to choose a component that we would most like to improve upon and practice using.</p>
			<h3>How Would I Make This</h3>
			<p>Step One: Use the < header > tag to start the section of content where all the header's contents will be located.</p>
			<p>Step Two: Between the open and closing tags of the header, decide what is going to be contained within.</p>
			<p>Step Three: Decide on creating a navigation menu. Use the < nav > tag to create a navigation within the previously created < header >.</p>
			<p>Step Four: Use the < ul > (unordered list) tag inside the < nav > tags.</p>
			<p>Step Five: Use the < li > tag within the newly created unordered list for as many items as the menu needs.</p> 
			<p>Step Six: Use further < ul > tags containing < li > elements within the navigation menu in order to create any needed submenus or drop-downs.</p>

                                <p>In web design, a CTA is a banner, button, or some type of graphic or text on a website meant to prompt a user to click it and continue down a conversion funnel. It is an essential part of inbound marketing as well as permission marketing in that it actively strives to convert a user into a lead and later into a customer. The main goal of a CTA is a click, or a scan in the case of a qr code, and its success can be measured via a conversion rate formula that calculates the number of clicks over the times the CTA was seen. - Wikipedia</p>

                                <p>HTML5 has a footer element that can be used to contain and display all these sorts of things, and most of the time, the footer is the last (and least attention-getting) element on the web page that a person sees. One of the most important things that I would like to get into the habit of doing is making sure that within my footer, I include a site map if the site I have created is spanned across multiple pages.</p>

                                <p>Forms in a web page are something that's almost surely extremely useful to the developer, they can have a variety of purposes in a page, and therefore create a bit of diversity in what you can do with them. I have chosen this component because I believe that they're under-used in general, and by me, so I want to get more into the habit of making sure to utilize form fields.</p>

                                <p>HTML Forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. They allow users to send data to the web site. Most of the time that data is sent to the web server, but the web page can also intercept it to use it on its own. An HTML Form is made of one or more widgets. Those widgets can be text fields (single line or multiline), select boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons. Most of the time, those widgets are paired with a label that describes their purpose. - MDN</p>

                                <p>Creating form fields is pretty easy in this era of the web. Using the corresponding elements like < textarea > and < label > within the < form > tags are quick and painless ways to give the user of your site a means to contact you. You start with the < form > element and add whatever is needed within (like input fields, check boxes, labels, and buttons) depending on what the form is being used for.</p>
